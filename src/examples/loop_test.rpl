------------------------------------------

This program is an example of a loop.
The first line calclulates the number
of following characters to record
(including whitespace) and calls the 
log command. This logs the following x
characters into an array. The p command
then calls the characters logged, pushes
them into the file, and executes them.
This can essentially be used as a call or
goto command.
